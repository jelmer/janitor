Description: platform for making automated VCS changes
 Platform built on top of silver-platter that can continuously make
 changes to a set of version control repositories.
 .
 It tries to continuously run scripts against the set of repositories it
 knows about. It tries to be clever about scheduling those operations that
 are more likely to yield results and be published (i.e. merged or pushed).
 .
 Depending on the preferences of repository owners, changes can be committed
 and pushed upstream directly, be proposed in the form of pull requests
 or attached to bug reports.
 .
 A web UI and tooling is provided to manage and review changes in bulk and
 report on changes made.

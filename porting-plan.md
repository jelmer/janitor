## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach

1. **Incremental Migration**: Each service should be implemented with Python compatibility layers initially
2. **API Parity**: Maintain exact HTTP API compatibility during migration
3. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive integration tests comparing Python vs Rust behavior
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure and document performance improvements
5. **Gradual Deployment**: Deploy services one at a time with rollback capability

### Technical Considerations

#### Dependencies to Add
```toml
# Web and API
axum = "0.8"
tower = "0.5"
tera = "1.19"              # Template engine
serde = "1.0"
serde_json = "1.0"

# Authentication & Security  
jsonwebtoken = "9.0"
oauth2 = "4.4"
bcrypt = "0.15"

# Database & Storage
sqlx = "0.8"
redis = "0.27"
google-cloud-storage = "0.22"
google-cloud-auth = "0.17"

# VCS Integration
git2 = "0.18"
breezyshim = ">=0.1.173"

# Debian/APT Tools
debian-control = "0.1"
debversion = "0.4"
flate2 = "1.0"             # Compression

# Testing & Development
tokio-test = "0.4"
tempfile = "3.19"
```

#### Architecture Patterns

1. **Service-Oriented**: Each major component becomes a separate service
2. **Shared Libraries**: Common functionality in the root `janitor` crate
3. **API Gateway**: Central routing and authentication (potentially via the site service)
4. **Event-Driven**: Redis pub/sub for inter-service communication
5. **Configuration-Driven**: TOML-based configuration with environment overrides

### Risk Mitigation

#### High-Risk Components
1. **Site Templates**: Complex Jinja2 templates need careful migration to Tera
2. **Authentication**: OpenID Connect and session management requires thorough testing
3. **Database Schema**: Ensure data structure compatibility during migration
4. **VCS Integration**: Git and Bazaar operations need extensive testing

#### Migration Strategy
1. **Feature Flags**: Allow switching between Python and Rust implementations
2. **Shadow Mode**: Run Rust services alongside Python for comparison
3. **Rollback Plan**: Keep Python implementations available during initial deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Extensive logging and metrics to catch migration issues

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Differ) | 1-2 weeks | None | Low |
| Phase 2 (Infrastructure) | 4-6 weeks | Phase 1 | Medium |
| Phase 3 (Site) | 8-12 weeks | Phase 2 | High |
| Phase 4 (Cupboard) | 4-6 weeks | Phase 3 | Medium |
| Phase 5 (VCS Stores) | 3-4 weeks | Phase 2 | Medium |
| Phase 6 (Debian) | 3-4 weeks | Phase 2 | Low |
| Phase 7 (Support) | 1-2 weeks | Various | Low |

**Total Estimated Duration: 24-36 weeks (6-9 months)**

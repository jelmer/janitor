The Janitor sits atop a number of other projects, and those are where

Environment
===========

Mostly you can use pip to install Python-based dependencies. In addition to
those, you'll also want to install various other bits of software. On Debian,
run:

 $ sudo apt install libgpgme-dev rustc libapt-pkg-dev

# TODO: Janitor Platform - Consolidated TODO List

This document consolidates all TODO items from across the Janitor codebase, including external dependencies, porting tasks, and implementation gaps.

## 📊 Project Status Overview

The Janitor platform migration from Python to Rust is **99%+ complete**:
- **Total Lines Ported**: ~20,100+ lines (from ~18,000 lines Python)
- **Actual Remaining Python**: ~700-800 lines (mostly utilities and auto-upload service)
- **Major Services**: All ported ✅ (Runner, Publisher, Differ, Site, Cupboard, Git Store, Archive, Auto-Upload, BZR Store)

## 🚨 CRITICAL - External Dependencies & Blockers

### PyO3 / Breezyshim API Limitations
- [ ] **Symbolic Reference Creation** (worker/src/vcs.rs:272)
  - Blocked by: PyO3 API stabilization in breezyshim crate
  - Impact: Tag symbolic references not created, operations continue without error
  - Current: Returns Ok() to allow operations to continue

- [ ] **Bazaar Transport Support** (bzr-store/src/pyo3_bridge.rs:322)
  - Blocked by: PyO3 binding complexity for transport objects
  - Impact: May affect Bazaar operation performance

- [ ] **Bazaar Probers Support** (bzr-store/src/pyo3_bridge.rs:323)
  - Blocked by: PyO3 binding complexity for prober objects
  - Impact: May affect repository format detection

### External API Integrations
- [ ] **VCS Forge Resume Information** (runner/src/resume.rs:122)
  - Blocked by: Need to implement GitHub/GitLab/etc API queries
  - Impact: Cannot determine if merge proposals can be resumed

- [ ] **Merge Proposal Merged-By Information** (publish/src/web.rs:274-276)
  - Blocked by: Need external forge API calls
  - Impact: Cannot display link to user who merged proposal

- [ ] **Forge Rate Limits** (publish/src/web.rs:1502)
  - Blocked by: Need to query forge APIs for rate limit status
  - Impact: Incomplete rate limit information shown to users

### Framework Limitations
- [ ] **HTTP Response Streaming** (git-store/src/git_http.rs:532)
  - Blocked by: Better streaming support in Axum
  - Impact: Higher memory usage for large Git operations
  - Current: Buffers entire response

### Database Migration Dependencies
- [ ] **Codebase Table Usage** (publish/src/state.rs:158)
  - Blocked by: Database schema migration to use codebase table
  - Impact: Some queries may be less efficient

### Configuration System Dependencies
- [ ] **Dynamic Configuration Loading** (site/src/config.rs:384,389,394,399,410)
  - Blocked by: Janitor config integration
  - Impact: Service URLs are hardcoded or use defaults

## 🧪 TESTING - Test Infrastructure

### Database-Dependent Tests
- [ ] **runner/src/resume.rs:302** - test_resume_result requires real database
- [ ] **worker/src/vcs.rs** - Multiple tests require system dependencies

### Runner Service Tests
- [ ] **Tests disabled pending LogConfig implementation** (integration_tests.rs:214,226)
- [ ] **Mock database and failure details testing** (core_functionality_tests.rs:260,262,266)

### Publish Service Tests
- [ ] **Multiple test functions marked with #[ignore]** due to unimplemented functionality

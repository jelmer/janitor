## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Security Utilities (`src/security.rs`)
```rust
// Comprehensive filename validation
pub fn validate_filename(filename: &str) -> Result<(), String>

// Safe path joining with boundary checks  
pub fn safe_path_join(base_dir: &Path, filename: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, String>

// Command injection prevention
pub fn validate_command_arg(arg: &str) -> Result<(), String>

// SQL injection prevention for LIKE patterns
pub fn sanitize_sql_like_pattern(input: &str) -> String
```

### Database Infrastructure (`src/database.rs`)
```rust
// Shared database with configuration builder pattern
let db = Database::connect_with_config(
    DatabaseConfig::new(&url)
        .with_max_connections(10)
        .with_idle_timeout(Duration::from_secs(600))
).await?;
```

### Memory-Efficient Streaming (`worker/src/client.rs`)
```rust
// Replaced memory loading with streaming
let file = tokio::fs::File::open(&file_path).await?;
let stream = tokio_util::io::ReaderStream::new(file);
let body = reqwest::Body::wrap_stream(stream);
```

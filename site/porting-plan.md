## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Replacement**: Implement services one by one with feature flags
2. **Template-First**: Focus on template migration early to enable rapid iteration
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintain exact HTTP API compatibility during migration
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark against Python implementation continuously

### Technical Considerations

#### Template Migration Strategy
- Use Tera's Jinja2 compatibility mode
- Create automated template validation tools
- Implement side-by-side comparison testing
- Maintain template feature parity

#### Database Migration
- Reuse existing PostgreSQL schema
- Port complex queries incrementally
- Maintain transaction compatibility
- Add query performance monitoring

#### Authentication Migration
- Preserve existing session tokens during transition
- Implement gradual OIDC provider migration
- Maintain user role compatibility
- Add security audit logging

### Risk Mitigation

#### High-Risk Areas
1. **Template Compatibility**: Jinja2→Tera syntax differences
2. **Authentication Flow**: OIDC integration complexity
3. **Database Queries**: Complex asyncpg→sqlx conversion
4. **Real-time Features**: Redis pub/sub integration

#### Migration Strategy
1. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout of Rust components
2. **Parallel Deployment**: Run both versions side-by-side initially
3. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive comparison testing
4. **Rollback Plan**: Quick revert to Python if issues arise

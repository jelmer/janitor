    </h3>
    <p>Simply give the bot commit access to your repository, and it will push fixes rather than proposing them.</p>
    <p>
        The bot will need permission to push to the relevant branches. For
        repositories on a GitLab instances (such as salsa) this means that
        it will need developer permissions if the relevant branch is unprotected,
        and maintainer permissions if the relevant branch is protected.
        See the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html">GitLab permissions guide</a> for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        For GitHub repositories, the bot needs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write access to the repository</li>
        <li>Permission to push to the target branch (may require special configuration for protected branches)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note: Direct pushes will only happen for changes that meet certain quality thresholds.
        More experimental or risky changes will still be submitted as merge proposals even if
        the bot has push access.

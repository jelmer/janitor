    </h3>
    <p>
        The Janitor supports several version control systems and hosting platforms:
    </p>
    
    <h4>Version Control Systems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git</strong> - Full support for Git repositories</li>
        <li><strong>Bazaar (bzr)</strong> - Legacy support for Bazaar repositories</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Hosting Platforms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - Pull requests and direct pushes</li>
        <li><strong>GitLab</strong> - Merge requests and direct pushes (including self-hosted instances)</li>
        <li><strong>Launchpad</strong> - Merge proposals for Bazaar and Git</li>
        <li><strong>Salsa (Debian GitLab)</strong> - Specialized support for Debian packaging</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Protocol Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTPS repositories (public and private with authentication)</li>
        <li>SSH repositories (with appropriate key configuration)</li>
        <li>Git protocol (for public repositories)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Note:</strong> While Bazaar repositories are supported for legacy reasons,
        new development focuses primarily on Git repositories. If you have a Bazaar
        repository, consider migrating to Git for better long-term support.

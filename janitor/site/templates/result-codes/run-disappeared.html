<p>The management plane for the worker no longer knows about the
job that was processing the run. This can happen because e.g.
the management plane for the worker was restarted, or because the worker
failed to upload its results to the runner, possibly because the
runner was down or rejected the uploads - it could be crashing
while processing them.</p>

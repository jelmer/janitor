    Attempting to access the packaging branch resulted in a HTTP
    <b>401 Unauthorized</b> error. This can indicate that the repository is
    private, that accessing it may require log in, or that it simply does not
    exist.

    This can happen due to Breezy not sending credentials to GitLab
    repositories. See
    <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/janitor/issues/19">this bug</a>
    for details.

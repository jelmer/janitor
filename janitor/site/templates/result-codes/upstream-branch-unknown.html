<p>The location of the upstream repository of this package is unknown. The canonical location
for this information is the <b>Repository</b> field in the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/UpstreamMetadata">debian/upstream/metadata</a> file.
</p>

<p>The Janitor will also fall back to attempting to reading various other metadata files
to figure out the upstream repository location, such as <i>dist.ini</i> (for perl packages)
or <i>setup.py</i> (for Python packages).

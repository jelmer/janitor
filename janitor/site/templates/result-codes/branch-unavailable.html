<p>The packaging branch at {% if vcs_url %}({{ vcs_url }}){% endif %} can not be
reached.</p>

<p>This problem may be intermittent, e.g. if the hosting site is temporarily down.</p>

<p>If the repository has moved, please update the <i>Vcs-*</i> headers
in the package and upload a new version.</p>

<p>You can also update the Vcs locations on <a href="https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch?{% if run %}package={{ run.package }}{% endif %}">vcswatch</a>.</p>

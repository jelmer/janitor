    </h3>
    <p>
        The Janitor will automatically reschedule processing of packages with a
        conflicted merge proposal. Once a conflict appears, it may take a couple of
        hours before the merge proposal is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will also regularly rebase merge proposals on the packaging branch. It
        can take several days before this happens, since there is no mechanism to
        notify the janitor of new commits. You can manually trigger a rerun
        from the package-specific page linked from the merge proposal.

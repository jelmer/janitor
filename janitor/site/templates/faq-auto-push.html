    </h3>
    <p>Simply give the bot commit access to your repository, and it will push fixes rather than proposing them.</p>
    <p>
        The bot will need permission to push to the relevant branches. For
        repositories on a GitLab instances (such as salsa) this means that
        it will need developer permissions if the relevant branch is unprotected,
        and maintainer permissions if the relevant branch is protected.
        See the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html">GitLab permissions guide</a> for details.

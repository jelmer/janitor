        <p>
            The initial version of the Janitor was written by <a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/">Jelmer Vernooĳ</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code for the Debian-specific instance has now been split out into a <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/janitor-team/janitor.debian.net/">separate
        repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Many thanks to everybody who has provided feedback and helped make the Janitor better.</p>
    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>The janitor itself is mostly written in Python, using the following libraries and services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The style for the website is based on <a href="https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster">Alabaster 0.7.8</a> theme for sphinx.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a class="reference external" href="https://www.breezy-vcs.org/">Breezy</a>
            provides abstractions over the version control system (Git, Bazaar,
            Mercurial, Subversion) and the supported hosting platforms (GitHub,
            GitLab, Launchpad).
        </li>

            <a class="reference external"
               href="https://jelmer.uk/code/silver-platter/">Silver-Platter</a>
            ties this all together; it manages branches, invokes codemods and pushes back or creates
            merge proposals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a class="reference external" href="https://diffoscope.org/">Diffoscope</a> is used to show the diff between binary packages.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The source code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jelmer/janitor">on GitHub</a>.

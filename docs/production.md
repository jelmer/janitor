# Running Janitor in production

There are [containers](Dockerfiles_.md) available for each of the Janitor services.

[pre-built containers](https://github.com/jelmer?tab=packages&repo_name=janitor) are
available, but you can also create them yourself:

```console
$ sudo apt install \
    buildah \
    make
$ make build-all
```

## Database

The services share a single PostgreSQL database. Before starting anything,
load the schema:

```console
$ createdb janitor
$ cat schema/state.sql | psql janitor
$ cat schema/debian/debian.sql | psql janitor  # only if using the Debian-specific features
```

Workers authenticate against the runner with HTTP Basic Auth, checked against
the `worker` table. Passwords are hashed with pgcrypto:

```console
$ psql janitor -c "INSERT INTO worker (name, password) VALUES ('myworker', crypt('mypassword', gen_salt('bf')))"
```

The worker process itself needs those same credentials supplied to it -
inserting the row above only lets the runner *accept* a login, it does not
give any worker one. `janitor-worker` looks for them in this order:
`--credentials <file>` (a JSON file with `login`/`password`), the
`WORKER_NAME`/`WORKER_PASSWORD` environment variables, or embedded directly
in `--base-url` (`http://myworker:mypassword@runner-host/`).

## Forge credentials

Publishing merge proposals requires a forge API token (GitHub/GitLab/etc),
but this is not part of janitor.conf - publish and runner delegate to
breezy's own credential store instead, at
`~/.config/breezy/authentication.conf`.

For GitHub, run:

```console
$ brz github-login
```

which prompts for a username and token and writes the `[Github]` section
itself. To do it by hand instead, the section breezy expects is:

```
[Github]
scheme = https
host = github.com
url = https://api.github.com
private_token = <your token>
```

## Web UI login

The web UI supports OAuth2 login, configured via `oauth2_provider` in
`janitor.conf`:

```
oauth2_provider {
  base_url: "https://salsa.debian.org/"
  qa_reviewer_group: "janitor-reviewers"
  admin_group: "janitor-admins"
}
```

`client_id`/`client_secret` can go directly in `oauth2_provider`, or be left
out and set via the `OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`/`OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET` environment
variables instead, which are used as a fallback if the config fields are empty.

The provider needs a matching OAuth App/client registered with it first,
with its callback URL set to `<external_url>/oauth/callback`.

## Optional configuration

A few `janitor.conf` fields are optional, each with a clean fallback if left
unset:

- `git_location`/`bzr_location` - where `git_store`/`bzr_store` repos live
  (a local path, or a remote URL pointing at a `git_store`/`bzr_store`
  instance). Without these, that VCS type is not available at all.
- `zipkin_address` - a Zipkin endpoint; if set, enables distributed tracing
  at a 0.1 sample rate. No tracing without it.
- `user_agent` - the HTTP User-Agent `differ`/`publish` send on outbound
  requests. Falls back to a library default if unset.

For a Janitor instance, you probably want a custom website in combination with
the Janitor API. See the existing instances for inspiration.
